The process to creating this model involves the following steps:

[**Step 1**](FinalProject/Step1.ipynb): Gathering the data, downloading the information from OpenDataPhilly/DVRPC and using an API to gather 311 data.

[**Step 2**](FinalProject/Step2.ipynb): Cleaning that data and joining it to the street network for analysis.

[**Step 3**](FinalProject/Step3.ipynb): Creating the predictive model and testing its predictive power with the 2023 Street Paving Program and List.

[**Step 4**](FinalProject/Step4v3.ipynb): Predict the streets being repaved in 2024 and mapping these streets.
